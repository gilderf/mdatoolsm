MATLAB is a great to deal with matrices and arrays, however one has to do a lot of rutine operations to represent the matrix values properly. Usually we have names for variables and objects or labels for measurements in our data. However, dealing with the names and labels in MATLAB is not an easy job. One of the ways to solve this issue is to use <i>dataset</i> ? a specific object, which is a wrapper for an conventional numeric matrix, giving possibilties to use names more or less easily. Such objects exist in many toolboxes (including Statistics Toolbox) and the <i>mdatools</i> is not an exception here. Moreover, in <i>mdatools</i> dataset is a main way to represent any values. Scores, loadings, residuals, regression coefficients and so on are datasets in <i>mdatools</i>. Therefore is is important to start with introduction what dataset is, how to create and manipulate datasets.</p><p>Actually in <i>mdatools</i> datasets give a lot more options than just a possibility to have names for rows and columns of a matrix. They allow to hide rows and columns without removing them (for example when one need to remove an outlier or do variable selection), one can use qualitative data, factors, to group values and so on. But in this qick guide we will talk only about most important features of datasets, namely names/labels for rows and columns, making subsets, displaying data values, doing mathematical calculations and making plots.</p><p>Dataset can be created from any matrix (array with two dimensions: rows and columns). Actually it is not necessary to provide names for the dimensions. Column names will be generated automatically and row names will remain empty. Here is an example for 3x2 matrix with height and weight values for three persons:</p><pre class="codeinput">   values = [180 84; 170 68; 165 71];
   d = mdadata(values);

% This document gives a brief introduction to the basic functionality of _mdatools_

%% Introduction to datasets
%
% One of the most important things in the MDA toolbox is a _dataset_ object. MATLAB is a great 
% to deal with matrices and arrays, however one has to do a lot of rutine operations to represent 
% the matrix values properly. Usually we have names for variables and objects or labels for 
% measurements in our data. However, dealing with the names and labels in MATLAB is not an 
% easy job. One of the ways to solve this issue is to use _dataset_ ? a specific object, which 
% is a wrapper for an conventional numeric matrix, giving possibilties to use names more or less
% easily. Such objects exist in many toolboxes (including Statistics Toolbox) and the _mdatools_ is
% not an exception here. Moreover, in _mdatools_ dataset is a main way to represent any values.
% Scores, loadings, residuals, regression coefficients and so on are datasets in _mdatools_.
% Therefore is is important to start with introduction what dataset is, how to create and manipulate
% datasets.
%
% Actually in _mdatools_ datasets give a lot more options than just a possibility to have names for
% rows and columns of a matrix. They allow to hide rows and columns without removing them (for example 
% when one need to remove an outlier or do variable selection), one can use qualitative data,
% factors, to group values and so on. But in this qick guide we will talk only about most important
% features of datasets, namely names/labels for rows and columns, making subsets, displaying data
% values, doing mathematical calculations and making plots.
%
% Dataset can be created from any matrix (array with two dimensions: rows and columns). Actually it 
% is not necessary to provide names for the dimensions. Column names will be generated automatically
% and row names will remain empty. Here is an example for 3x2 matrix with height and weight values 
% for three persons:
%

   values = [180 84; 170 68; 165 71];
   d = mdadata(values);
   
   show(d)
   
%%
% Function |show()| displays data values as a table. By default it uses three significant figures,

   values = [180 84; 170 68; 165 71];

%
% The |mdadata| is a MATLAB object which has several properties and many methods. You can see some
% of the properties by using |disp()|.

   disp(d)
   
%% 
% The most important ones are |values|, which is a matrix with data values, |rowNames| - cell array
% with row names and |colNames| - cell array with column names. All three can be changed manually for 
% the whole object or for particular rows or columns. You can also specify name of the datasetm short 
% information text and labels for each of the two dimensions

   d.rowNames = {'Lars', 'Peter', 'Anna'};
   show(d)
   
   d(1, :).rowNames = 'Mike';
   show(d)
   
   d.name = 'People';
   d.info = 'People data for quick start guide';
   d.dimNames  = {'Persons', 'Parameters'};
   show(d)

%%
% You can subset the dataset values using the same way as with matrices: by specifying indices for
% rows and columns. All special names and symbols, like |:| and |end| will work properly.
% Alternatively column and row names can be used for the same purpose.

   show(d(1:2, :))

% The |mdadata| class has most of the standard mathematical and statistical methods overrided. This 
% means that you can work with datasets just as with conventinal matrices in MATLAB. Result of any 
% operation is also a dataset (object of class |mdadata|). For example, let's calculate BMI index 
% for our data values.

show(d)
bmi = d(:, 'Weight') ./ (d(:, 'Height') / 100) .^ 2;
bmi.colNames = 'BMI';

show(bmi)

%% Simple plots
%
% The |mdadata| also overrides several plotting methods, including |scatter()|, |plot()|, |bar()| 
% and several others, including statistical plots, such as |hist()|, |boxplot()| and |qqplot()|. It 
% means that if one provided an |mdadata| object as a first argument for these functions, a
% specially written version will be used instead of conventional MATLAB methods. Thus to make a
% scatter plot one have to provide a dataset with one or two columns. If more than two are
% available, |scatter()| method will ignore them.

   figure
   subplot(1, 2, 1)
   scatter(d)
   subplot(1, 2, 2)
   plot(d)
   
%%
% As you can see the labels for axes as well as title for the plot were set automatically using
% dataset names. Color of data points, lines and bars are selected automatically but one can specify 
% these and several other most important arguments for each plot. There are also additional options,

   scatter(d, 'Marker', 'd', 'Color', 'g', 'Labels', 'names')
   subplot(1, 2, 2)
   bar(d('Mike', :), 'FaceColor', 'b', 'Labels', 'values')
   
%% Univariate statistics
%
% There are several statistic methods available also for the |mdadata| datasets. To demonstrate this 
% we will use a subset of dataset |'people'|, which is provided with the toolbox. In the dataset there 
% are values for 32 persons from scandinavian and medditeranian regions (50% males, 50% females). Here 
% are some examples.
