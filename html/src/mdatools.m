% datasets interactively.

% The toolbox was tested using MATLAB 2012b and should also work on later
% versions. For the basic functionality you do not need any toolbox
% installed, however for GUI tools Image Processing toolbox is needed. All
% methods were tested using well-known datasets. However there
% still could be some bugs, in this case please report to
