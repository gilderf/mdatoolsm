%% GUI plotting tools 
%
% |guiplot| is a GUI tool for exploring data with plots interactively
% User can change type of plot, main parameters of the current plot as well 
% as manipulate objects and variables.
%
% The manipulation includes, first of all, selection, excluding, and
% including of objects on scatter plot and variables on lineseries plot.
% The following shortcats can be used (click on axes before):
%
% |s| - start polygon (scatter) or rectangular (line) selection. Double
%  click inside the selection figure when it is ready.
%
% |i| - invert current selection.
%
% |e| - exclude selected objects or variables.
%
% |a| - add the selected excluded objects or variables back.
%
% Finally using |Ctrl-s| allows to save current plot as a file. Below two
% screenshots are shown as an example ? first when user is selecting data
% points on a scatter plot with excluded objects shown and the second when
% selection is finished.
